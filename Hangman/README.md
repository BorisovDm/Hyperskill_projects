# Project: Hangman

**About:** Games can help you kill time when you’re bored - and here we don’t mean smartphone games, but the classic paper-and-pencil ones. However, we aren’t inviting you to kill time: on the contrary, we offer to write a game and improve your programming skills. In this project, you will work on the Hangman, a game where the player is supposed to guess a word letter by letter. Make a program that plays Hangman with you - and good luck with the guessing!

**Result:** Best project for Python Basics: functions, loops, lists and other variables. And Random module as a cherry on top. Don’t be intimidated by the number of stages, they ensure that your dive in Python is smooth and safe.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn:

**Stage #1:** Hello, Hangman

Welcome the user: print “The game will be available soon”

**Stage #2:** I want to play a game

For now, the player will have only one chance to guess the word. Learn “Input” and “if” to implement the stage.

**Stage #3:** Make your choice

Make the game more challenging: now it will randomly choose one of four words from a list.

**Stage #4:** Help is on the way

Enable hints in your game: let it show the number of letters and first three letters. Slicing will help you to implement this part.

**Stage #5:** Keep trying

Using a loop, extend the number of attempts to eight. Now we’re talking!

**Stage #6:** The value of life

The outcome of the game may be “fatal” - a feature that makes the game all the more exciting. Work on implementing this feature so that players don’t lose “lives” if they guess the letter right. The While loop will help.

**Stage #7:** Error!

Improve the game by handling different error cases. Repetition of a letter, entering too many or using non-Latin characters shouldn’t cost your player a life.

**Stage #8:** Menu, please

A dinner starts with the menu: our projects ends with one. Create a menu for your game so that players can replay it or exit.
