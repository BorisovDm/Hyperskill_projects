# Project: Coffee Machine in Python

**About:** What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee-machine simulator. The machine works with quite typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. The machine can make three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

**Result:** This project allows you to get a taste of Python. An important part of Python are functions, and this is what you will practice here. Try yourself at working with loops and conditions and get more confident in Python programming.

## What you’ll do and what you’ll learn:

**Stage #1:** Hello, coffee!
Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

**Stage #2:** Machines have needs

Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

**Stage #3:** Enough coffee for everyone

Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

**Stage #4:** Action!

Upgrade your knowledge of functions - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

**Stage #5:** On a coffee loop

Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you press exit.
